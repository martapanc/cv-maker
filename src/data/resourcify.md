Full-stack work involving development of greenfield tools and maintenance of legacy components, covering a diverse range of projects and technologies, adapting to new challenges and delivering quality results.

- My career started in the Recycler API/Platform Core team, where I honed my skills in building robust and scalable applications.

- Later, I joined the Accounting Squad, where I took a leading role in developing a new accounting platform for internal and client use. I approached this project with a focus on user experience, performance, and maintainability, resulting in a successful product launch. In close collaboration with the Accounting Ops, I actively sought feedback to continuously improve the functionality of the platform, ensuring it met their specific needs.

- I scaled the application to serve a growing number of clients and their orders and invoices, and I ensured that the application could handle larger volumes of data with minimal latency, resulting in faster processing and improved overall system performance.

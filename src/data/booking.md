I joined the Graduate scheme, involving a team rotation every 6 months â€“ a unique opportunity to gain expertise across
the various services within the company.

Some backend projects involved:

- migrating the legacy Pricing Engine to a modern Spring API as part of restructuring towards microservices
  architecture.
- improving the platform that communicates with supplier APIs and manages the automated reservation process.

In the frontend area I:

- maintained the Payment page of Rentalcars.com and Sanction Screening tool.
- developed and scaled the "Premium" insurance product, expanding from small airports to many popular holiday
  destinations and driving revenue growth.
- Contributed to web replatforming, developing filters for Rentalcars' results page and creating React-based "Premium"
  and "Full Insurance" upsell banners, integrated into the main webapp.

Also conducted interviews identifying top talent to join the team, and helped implementing WFH techniques during
Covid-19, enhancing productivity, communication and overall well-being.

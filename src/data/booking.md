I joined the Graduate scheme, involving a team rotation every 6 months â€“ a unique opportunity to gain expertise across the various services within the company.

Some backend projects involved:

- the migration of the legacy Pricing Engine to a modern Spring API as part of restructuring towards microservices architecture.
- the improvement of the platform that communicates with supplier APIs and manages the automated reservation process.

In the frontend area:

- I maintained the Payment page of Rentalcars.com and Sanction Screening tool, in compliance with industry standards.
- I contributed to the development and scaling of the new "Premium" insurance product, driving revenue growth starting from a few small airports, then expanding the market presence to several popular holiday destinations.
- and contributed to web-replatforming efforts, developing various filters for the Rentalcars results page and creating "Premium" and "Full Insurance" upsell banners using React, seamlessly integrating them into the main webapp.

I also conducted interviews for the company's graduate scheme, identifying top talent to join the team, and helped implementing WFH techniques during Covid-19, enhancing productivity, communication and overall well-being.
